<h3 align="center">Detection of Credit Card Frauds</h3>

This project delves into the intricate world of credit card fraud detection using machine learning, showcasing my expertise in:

**Data Handling and Preprocessing:**
 - Data Acquisition: Obtained the heavy data file directly from Kaggle, bypassing the need to store it locally. This approach ensured efficient handling of large datasets without compromising on processing speed or resource utilization.
- Imbalanced Dataset Management: Effectively tackled the challenge of imbalanced data (0.172% fraud) through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with scikit-learn, ensuring robust model training.
- Data Transformation: Employed robust scaling and standardization techniques to prepare the data for analysis.
- Splitting and Shuffling: Maintained data integrity by shuffling rows and splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

**Model Development and Evaluation:**
 - Extensive Model Exploration: Investigated the performance of 10 distinct machine learning models, including logistic regression, shallow neural networks, random forests, and gradient boosting classifiers.
 - Performance Analysis: Demonstrated a keen understanding of model evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score, going beyond just accuracy to assess true 
effectiveness in fraud detection.
 - Hyperparameter Tuning: Attempted to mitigate overfitting issues in neural networks by adjusting parameters such as the number of ReLU layers, showcasing an awareness of best practices.

**Key Tools and Techniques:**
 - Machine Learning Libraries: Utilized the capabilities of scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, and NumPy within Google Colab for efficient development and execution.
 - Data Science Expertise: Employed advanced data science techniques like PCA for dimensionality reduction and robust scaling for data normalization.

**Project Outcomes:**
 - Imbalanced Data Impact: Identified the detrimental effect of imbalanced data on model performance, achieving significantly better results with a balanced dataset.
 - Model Selection: Highlighted the importance of considering the business context when choosing a model, emphasizing the trade-off between precision and recall.
 - In-depth Exploration: Demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of various machine learning models and their suitability for tackling credit card fraud detection.

**Conclusion:**<br>
This project not only showcases my ability to navigate the complexities of imbalanced data but also highlights my proficiency in effectively developing and evaluating machine learning models. By leveraging the power of popular data science tools, I've acquired invaluable knowledge and skills that empower me to delve deeper into the realm of fraud detection. With confidence in my capabilities, I am well-equipped to contribute to the creation of robust financial security systems, driving innovation and ensuring the integrity of financial transactions.
